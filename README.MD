# <h1>Library API</h1>

> Status: Developing⚠️

## 📋My object with this project

The idea is to create a system for a library, simple functions, example: CRUD between books, customers and rents. Thus discovering new methods of doing something new and training.

##🤯Features to be implemented in the future

1. Receive books by parameter and return them sorted by release date
   most recent but not greater than the current date

2. Return the books that were received by grouped parameter

3. Objects passed by parameter, requesting object and book object, must be checked if the requesting
   he has a lease in his name and the 30-day period has passed. If the deadline has expired, the system must
   calculate the 1% fine for each day passed after the deadline, and return the fine. Else returns 0.

## 🚀Technologies Used:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Java 17</td>
    <td>Spring Boot</td>
    <td>Lombok</td>
    <td>PostgreSQL</td>
    <td>Bean Validation</td>

   <tr>
      <td>17</td>
      <td>3.0</td>
      <td>Null</td>
      <td>15.2</td>
